## Description:
A company that decided to open a new field - gift delivery that is specific on good and cheap products that can be delivered -  needs a system. The system allows users to browse various gift types(items), place orders, manage payments, and track the delivery of gifts to recipients and if itâ€™s needed - refund them. 

The system supports different types of users, such as customer, employee, foundation account, business account. Users contain their id and phone number. Business accounts have information about their documentation(for business, corporation). Fondation accounts contain documentation that is needed for working with charity organisations.  Each employee contains their working schedule. Besides that, the employee can advise himself. 
Each client has their name and wishlist for adding their dreams for a birthday. Beside that, each client can have one type of subscription and one type of subscription can have many clients. The subscription contains the list of features and a price. There are two subscriptions for client- premium or standard. Premium account has some privileges such as a 0.5% discount for all products 0.5%, free delivery of orders, free priority of delivery. The Standard account doesn't have that privileges: no discount for each product, just for some holidays/events, no priority of delivery the order and playful delivery. Also in the system a client contains his own Wallet. Customer can contain just one wallet in his account and the wallet can have a unique customer.
